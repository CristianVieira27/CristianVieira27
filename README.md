### Hello ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to my Github profile!

About me :smile:

My name is Cristian Vieira, I'm Brazilian (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I'm starting my career in web development at [Escola Infoserv](http://www.escolainfoserv.com.br).

In my free time, I like to study and improve myself (ðŸ“š), watch things that add value (ðŸ“º), and listen to music (ðŸŽµ).

Would you like to meet me?
